        /// handling this request is currently blocked.
        /// until a database request is fulfilled now, in our case, it's hard to justify this is because of data.
        /// We have at the moment and what we're doing with the data.But imagine if we had a really complex query that went
        /// to database. If had to fetch a certain number of ecords from a database table that's got 5 million records in it.
        /// It will take longer. And if we are blocking a thread for that particular databse operation, then that's not a good thing
        /// Now, in modern Web servers, they are multi threaded
        /// And let's say, for e.g , you've got an Apache Web servers and it's got 100 threads available.
        /// you're thinking , well, that's no problem, I've got 100 threads to work with. Why can't one of them just wait for the data to come back?
        /// And the answer to that is, well,it's kind of wasteful
        /// Imagine if you had a thousands users, then your application can only serve 100 at any one time and it's wasting resource
        /// that were available. So what we can do is we can make our code asynchronous and we an tell our friend in this case, when
        /// you got to databsae, pass this request onto another thread, that that thread go and deal with getting the data.
        /// But in meant time, if anybody else hits this particular endpoint, I'm going to serve that request.

        /// And what this means is that our code application is instantly more scalable beacuse we make our code, especially
        /// our code, that case, the database, we make it a synchronous.
